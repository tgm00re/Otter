WHAT IS OTTER?
Developing a social media application that allows users to register and login, create ‚Äòposts,‚Äô like posts, comment on posts, become ‚Äòfriends‚Äô‚Äô with other users, view user profiles, explore different users and posts, send direct messages, and receive notification regarding information related to their account.

There was no wireframe for this project. Instead, it takes heavy inspiration from twitter's website.
